How it Works

Image preprocessing

Resizes images to fit the interface while keeping the aspect ratio.

Agent creation

Uses agno.Agent with Gemini as the LLM and DuckDuckGoTools for research references.

Multi-modal analysis

The agent processes both the uploaded image and structured prompt to produce a diagnostic report.

Display results

Streamlit shows a Markdown-formatted report with headings, bullet points, and disclaimers.

Supported Image Formats

.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .dicom

Note: DICOM files may require additional preprocessing for pixel array extraction.
